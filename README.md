# Meteor-Famous-Window-Panes
#
### Just an example I created to learn how to use famous.
###
### This has no reactivity, data, or even a database.
###
### It's purely testing out famous functionality while
### using the raix:famono package

1. `git clone https://github.com/mootzville/meteor-famous-window-panes`
2. `cd meteor-famous-window-panes && meteor`
